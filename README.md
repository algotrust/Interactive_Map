# Interactive_Map

This app closely follows and resembles the SuperZip app on RStudio page, https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/063-superzip-example. This started as a personal project/proof of concept to apply the SuperZip app to a different data source.
Throughout the building process, definitely ran into some issues in creating the map due to lack of understanding of the bindings.
After reading up on leaflet, shiny bindings, and trial/error re-creating this app to resemble SuperZip app,
I am now comfortable applying leaflet and other javascript visualizations to make more customizable applications based on my interest.
